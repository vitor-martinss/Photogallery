				<article>Hi, welcome to Photo Gallery, a website I've created for the purpose of practicing my programing skills.<br><br>This is the first of many I pretend to create. It was all from scratch, logo, design, galleries, etc. I've used programing languages such as HTML / CSS / JAVASCRIPT / JQUERY / PHP / and a plugin called Lightbox.<br><br>All pictures were taken from <br><a href="https://www.unsplash.com">Unsplash.com</a><br><br><br>I hope you enjoy the website as much as I enjoyed building it.<br><br><span>By the way I'm not the girl on this photo, is just another amazing picture from unsplash ;)</span></article>
